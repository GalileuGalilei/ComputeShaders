# ComputeShaders
### A little project to render complex images(fractals usually) using OpenGL compute shaders.

The project comes with a class to manage shaders and compute shaders, and meshes and also a special texture class `RenderTexture` to draw back from GPU.


A simple fractal was made using a compute shader.

### You can download the Visual Studio template here:
-- [ComputeShader.zip](https://github.com/GalileuGalilei/ComputeShaders/files/15088129/ComputeShader.zip)


### Installation Steps:
*  Go to your Visual Studio Templates folder, usually **[User]/Documents/Visual Studio 20XX/Templates/ProjectTemplates**
*  Drop the ComputeShader.zip file there.
*  You are done!
Now just go to your Visual Studio -> New Project, and in the search bar type "compute shader". The option to create a new project using the template should be shown.
